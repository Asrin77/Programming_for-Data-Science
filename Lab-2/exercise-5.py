"""Shopping Cart Processor

Create a list of dictionaries representing 4 products. Each dictionary should contain product name, price, and quantity. Use a for loop to calculate the total cost of the cart. Then write a function called apply_discount(total) that returns the final price after a 10% discount when the total is greater than or equal to 2,000; otherwise, no discount is applied."""
